# Fake-News-Detector
DO NOT USE THIS AS IS! It is an old, unmaintained project which might have a few insecurities and inconsistencies, and I have stopped maintaining it. You could, however, use it as an example project to base your own stuff from it.


## Prerequisites:
1. Any Python IDE.
2. Keras using Tensorflow backend
3. For natural language processing I have used spacy.
For spacy documentation, check https://spacy.io/usage/

### Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## About:
This is an ongoing project that tries to classify real and fake news through ANNs using Keras API. Three data files in .csv format are available to train or test models.

## Run:
### Linux:
1. Open terminal, cd into the folder and run `python fake.py`.

### Windows:
1. Run using any IDE. (I use spyder from Anaconda), or
2. Open command prompt or anaconda prompt as administrator, to download anaconda, check https://www.anaconda.com/download/ .
3. cd into the folder and run `python fake.py`.

### Mac OS:
1. Run using any IDE. (I use spyder from Anaconda), or
2. Open terminal, cd into the folder and run `python fake.py`.
